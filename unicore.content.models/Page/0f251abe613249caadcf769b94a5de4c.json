Nibble on ginger biscuits, sip on ginger ale or even better, buy some fresh ginger and add a few thin slices into a cup of boiling water with a spoonful of honey. \r\n\r\n**Combat a cold**  \r\nGarlic helps to clear out a blocked nose. So it makes sense that garlic is your new best friend if you\u2019re down with a cold or flu. Crush two cloves of garlic and leave them for 15 minutes to let the enzymes do their job. Then add honey and olive oil or butter and spread the mixture onto thin slices of bread. Ok, it\u2019s not the tastiest snack you\u2019ve had but it will be the healthiest!\r\n\r\n**Fight the flu**  \r\nLemon is full of the vitamins you need when you\u2019re down with the flu. Squeeze the juice of one or two lemons into a cup, add hot water and honey and you\u2019ve got a delicious drink packed with flu-fighting properties. \r\n\r\n**Cram the cranberry**  \r\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a bladder infection (sometimes called urinary tract infection) you\u2019ll know how painful it can be \u2013 think back pain, needing to urinate all the time and a burning sensation when you do urinate. Cranberry juice helps to fight the infection within eight hours! Don\u2019t forget to also drink lots of water to help flush the infection out. \r\n\r\n**Help your head**  \r\nThe bad news is that headaches are common, the good news is that it\u2019s easy to get rid of them. Drink lots of water and stay away from anything that will dehydrate you, like salty foods. If your headache is part of a cold, wrap some ice in a small cloth or towel and press it to your forehead. The coldness helps to numb the pain and improve blood circulation. \r\n\r\n**Remember\u2026**  \r\nIf any of these symptoms last for longer than two days, and you\u2019re not feeling better, then it may be time to see a health professional like a nurse, doctor or health worker at your nearest clinic or health centre. Don\u2019t be quiet if you\u2019re not feeling well, tell an adult you trust and make sure you get help. \r\n\r\n**Learn how to stop germs before they make you ill read more here:**",
