This is all very normal \u2013 it\u2019s called puberty and it means that you\u2019re turning from a girl into a woman. \r\n\r\n**Puberty? Tell me more\u2026**  \r\nEveryone is different, but one thing we all have in common \u2013 both boys and girls \u2013 is that we go through puberty. It is a time in your life that shows you\u2019re growing up into an adult. You could start puberty as young as 7 or 8 years old and it will last for up to four or five years, but no matter what age you start, we all eventually go through it. \r\n\r\n**The Change Stage**  \r\nMany things will start to happen with your body, here\u2019s what you need to know\u2026 \r\n\r\n- Your breasts will start to grow \r\n- You will get taller \r\n- Your skin and hair may become oilier \r\n- Your body will fill out and you may get curvier \r\n- You may start to get a few pimples\r\n- You\u2019ll grow hair under your arms and around your vagina (pubic hair)\r\n- You\u2019ll get your period \r\n\r\n**All About Your Period**  \r\nWhen you hit puberty, one of the most important changes in a girl\u2019s body is when you start your menstrual cycle (your period). This is when you bleed from your vagina for about three to five days. You\u2019ll get your period once a month, and your body prepares for it every day until you start to bleed again. Once you start menstruating, it means your body is also able to fall pregnant and have a baby. \r\n\r\nPuberty can be scary and exciting at the same time, but remember every woman goes through it so know you\u2019re not alone! \r\n\r\n**Learn more about what happens inside your body when you\u2019re on your period.**",
